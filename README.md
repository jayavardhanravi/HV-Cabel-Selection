# HV-Cable-Selection
SLD(Single line Diagram) is one of the important design document which serves as input drawing to many other drawings/documents. This design document gives a clear picture about the suitability of various types of cables for various loads in the power plant. This Document helps in arriving the estimation of cables which is finally useful in the procurement. Customer Specifications, Key SLD, individual board SLDâ€™s prepared by system engineering group serves as input documents/drawings to cable sizing document (both HT and LT power cables). The main information to be shown in cable sizing document is voltage grade of cable, number of runs of cable, type of cable, length of cable etc.,

## General Methodology
The method followed here is as below

1. Gathering data about the cable, its installation conditions, the load that it will carry, etc. 
- Determine the minimum cable size based on continuous current carrying capacity. 
- Determine the minimum cable size based on voltage drop considerations.
- Determine the minimum cable size based on short circuit temperature rise.
- Select the cable based on the highest of the sizes calculated in step 2, 3, 4 and 5

#### Note: 
###### The formulas for the calculation are as in the program.
